# object-galaxy
An animated galaxy created with HTML, CSS and printed information with JS.

Modals were created using JS classes, DOM and events.

Planets animations are a simulation of the real orbits. Some of them use 1 day as 1 sec and others 1 day as 10 or 100 secs for visual dynamism.

Colored orbits and planets use z-index in order to represent their position on our Solar System. Distance and size of all objects are not at scale at all.

RESPONSIVE DESIGN NOT AVAILABLE DUE TO POSITION AUTOMATIONS
